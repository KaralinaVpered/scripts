# scripts

A repo for prototyping small scripts.

## Format
All scripts are located in `./scripts` & each should have a header which describes the script's purpose and how to use it. For instance:

```
/*
 * This script is used to detect mismatched transactions between two nodes.
 * To use it simply make sure that the node's URLs are correctly set in your ENV.
*/
```
